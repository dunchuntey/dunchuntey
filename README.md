### Currently 
For the moment you can have a look at my CS50P final project, a kind of [algorithmic musical scale generator](https://github.com/dunchuntey/skeletons) that basically generates curated [pitch sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(music)).

Given my beginner level in Python, I imagine the project can be improved upon in most ways. Anyone interested is heartily invited to take a look.

### Otherwise
If using passion or some kind of long-term spiritual affinity as a metric for defining "what" I am, then I'm a composer (of music), with experience doing so both professionally, semi-professionally, and pseudo-professionally, as well as, more successfully and rewardingly, none of the above.

- I’m interested in: Music, musicology, making lists, bikes (rides not races), wanting to make little algorithm things related to music that I may lack the coding skills to make.
- I’m currently learning: Python.
