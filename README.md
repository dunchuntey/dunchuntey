### Currently 
At the moment I'm continuing to try to try to continue to build on the ideas in my [algorithmic musical scale generator](https://github.com/dunchuntey/skeletons), which basically generates curated [pitch sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(music)). The aim is to implement a further handful of variations on this initial concept.

Also, I've started to work on some [simple inversion programs](https://github.com/dunchuntey/transformation), which, where appropriate, I'll hopefully be able to pair up with the above pitch set generation stuff.
For now we have WIP programs for mirror (or "real") inversion and tonal inversion, and a prerequisite "negative harmony" program.

Given my beginner level in Python, I imagine the code can be improved upon in most ways. Anyone interested is heartily invited to take a look.

<!--- ### Otherwise
If using passion or some kind of long-term spiritual affinity as a metric for defining "what" I am, then I'm a composer (of music), with experience doing so both professionally, semi-professionally, and pseudo-professionally, as well as, more successfully and rewardingly, none of the above.

- I’m currently learning: Python.
