Hello. I'm Louis, I've taken up learning Python. I'm clueless, we'll see.

If using passion or some kind of long-term spiritual affinity as a metric for defining "what" I am, then I'm a composer (of music), with experience doing so both professionally, semi-professionally, and pseudo-professionally, as well as, more successfully and rewardingly, none of the above.

- I’m interested in: Music, musicology, making lists, bikes, wanting to make little algorithm things related to music that I lack the coding skills to make.
- I’m currently learning: Python.
